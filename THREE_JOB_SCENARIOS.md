## Data Generation Strategy

Each job will include:
- ✅ Complete project and job records
- ✅ Full SOV with 20-30 line items per job
- ✅ Monthly progress reports (6-10 reports per job)
- ✅ Weekly time entries (200-400 entries per job)
- ✅ AP Register entries (30-50 invoices per job)
- ✅ Cost-to-complete forecasts (monthly)
- ✅ Tasks and assignments
- ✅ GL Accounts and categories
- ✅ Users (project managers, supervisors, workers)

All data will be chronologically consistent and show realistic patterns that exercise the platform's reporting and KPI capabilities.
