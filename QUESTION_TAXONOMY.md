## 📝 Notes

- This taxonomy is exhaustive but not exhaustive - new question types will emerge
- Some questions may map to multiple tools
- Tool responses should be composable - combine multiple tools for complex queries
- Consider question patterns, not just individual questions
- User intent may be implicit - "show me problems" = "find at-risk jobs"
- Questions may span multiple categories - "show me everything about job X" requires multiple tools
- Natural language variations exist - "what's the status" = "tell me about" = "show me"
